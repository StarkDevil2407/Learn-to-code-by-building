# Automation Scripts

Small, practical Python scripts that automate everyday tasks.

Contains:
- `rename_files.py` — batch rename files in a folder
- `auto_email.py` — send simple email reports (SMTP; requires credentials)
- `folder_cleaner.py` — organize files into folders by extension
- `screenshot_bot.py` — take periodic screenshots (platform-specific)
- `wifi_passwords.py` — read saved Wi-Fi network info (OS-specific, use responsibly)

How to run:
- Install dependencies if needed (none for simple scripts, some require `Pillow` or `pyautogui`).
- Run: `python rename_files.py`
